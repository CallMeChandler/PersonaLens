# PersonaLens

PersonaLens is a multimodal credibility-signal explorer:
- Text: specificity, buzzword density, claim structure, timeline drift
- Audio/Video (later): stress-like cues and expression changes (non-diagnostic)

This project is for research/education and requires user consent for any personal data inputs.
